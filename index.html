        Abstract
      </p>
      <p id="text1">
        <span style="font-style: italic">The Yacoubian Building</span> brings together the rhizomatic nature of narratives and cities by overlaying stories of different characters, all of whom work or live in the Yacoubian building, in the current social environment of Cairo. The film's narrative is rhizomatic insofar as the characters have their own story interactions with each other by chance. These filmic interactions are imbued with the tensions of class distinctions, effectively depicting a moral microcosm of Egyptian society. By symbolizing each character and their story as Egypt’s different classes, the film is able to represent heterogeneous social layers while depicting an attenuating urban fabric. The film uses multiple subjective narratives to construct a collective urban imaginary representing a mutli-faceted society. This sort of narrative of multiple insiders in film challenges a single official narrative of Cairo. While the characters' storylines and social classes are separate, they are bound by their interaction within the urban and social makeup of the city.

        The building itself was built in 1934 by the Armenian Jewish businessman Hagop Yacoubian in an area where Ministers, landowners and foreign manufacturers already lived.

        During the the exodus of the Jewish and foreign owners in 1952 officers of the armed forces and their families have taken over the apartments.
        Then in the 70s these rich owners left the downtown to suburbs such as El Mohandiseen and Madinet Nasr and sold their apartments in the building or used them as offices or clinics.

        Later, a popular community will grow on the roof of the building because of the migration of workers from the countryside to Cairo in search of employment.

        'The Yacoubian Building is set in Cairo around 1990, the time of the Gulf War. Although it comes to represent this whole period of modern Egyptian society since the Revolution of 1952 where abolishing the monarchy leads to Nasser’s republic of Egypt and his reforms and Sadat’s opening up policies
        It follows the stories of several characters who live in the Yacoubian Building, a once-luxurious building that houses rich residents inside and a shanty town on its roof, creating a clear divide between the building’s rich and poor.’’

        The story follows 6 main characters through their daily lives as they move throughout the building, city and cross paths with each other

        Each character is an archetype representing a different socioeconomic class in Cairo. These characters are embedded and dramatized in the urban environment each responding differently to the corrupted social economic and political system.

        We want to show how mapping the characters' narratives onto the city allows us to understand the rhizomatic condition of Cairo; classes are different from each other but inseparable from each other and the urban fabric.
        The Yacoubian Building in the film represents that urban condition of Cairo and acts as a microcosm of the city.

              Zaki Bey is a elderly Pasha and one of the primary characters in the Yacoubian Building. He is a wealthy, foreign-educated engineer who represents the ruling class prior to the Revolution. He is cultured, cosmopolitan and spends his time and wealth pursuing women, while never settling down. For Zaki Bey “the past embodies power and grandeur not only for himself but also for the society” (Turan 491). He is nostalgic and resistant to the change and modernization of Egyptian society brought on by the revolution, clinging to memories of the “Old Cairo.” Of all the characters, he feels the strongest connection to the building itself saying, “I feel as though I owned the Yacoubian Building. I’m the longest resident in it. […] I lived my best days in it and I feel as though it’s part of me. The day this building is demolished or something happens to it, that will be the day I die” (Al Aswany 2004, p. 165).

            <p id="text2">
              These sentiments are expressed not only through dialogue, but also through his physical movements through the city. Compared to the other characters of similar economic status, Zaki Bey has a relatively limited physical range, primarily walking everywhere and never leaving Downtown Cairo or straying far from the Yacoubian Building. According to the novel, Zaki Bey shares an apartment with his sister Dawlat on Suleiman Basha Street, the same street as the Yacoubian Building, approximately a 10 min walk from the Yacoubian building. However, his commute to his office in the Yacoubian Building takes him at least an hour everyday because so many people stop him to ask for advice. His entertainment of these distractions and his reluctance to venture outside of his familiar places and interactions reflect his desire to keep a notion of both his and Cairo’s past power and grandeur alive within the Yacoubian Building and Downtown Cairo.

              As the film progresses, Zaki Bey begins a relationship with Busayna, a lower class resident of the Yacoubian Building’s rooftop community, who with the help of Malak’s scheming, gets a job as Zaki Bey’s secretary. Their relationship culminates in scandal followed by marriage, representing the potential, albeit a somewhat romanticized one, for societal transformation and overcoming of socio-economic and generational differences. Furthermore, the eventual and inevitable intersection of the lives of Zaki Bey and Busayna, which were previously isolated from one another through the physical separation between the rooftop community and the residents of the downstairs apartments, as well as by differences in their age and socio-economic class, is emblematic of the interconnected social and spatial structure of Cairo as a city. Despite spatial strategies of urban planning and development intended to draw physical divisions between different social stratas, the lives of the Cairenes are inextricable from the spatial fabric that allows them to  continue to intersect.

              Hatim is the son of an Egyptian lawyer and a French mother who works as the editor of Le Caire, a French language daily newspaper. Similarly to Zaki Bey, Hatim stays primarily in the elite bubble in the European quarters of Downtown Cairo between his apartment in the Yacoubian Building, office and restaurants/bars with his dates. Despite being in a very privileged section of Cairene life, Hatim is deeply discontent with his situation.

            <p id="text2">
              The movie primarily focuses on his private life, where Hatim navigates being a homosexual in a society that vehemently looks the other way or condemns such behaviours. He tries to find happiness by seducing Abd Rabbuh, a simple married Upper Egyptian. The movie presents this relationship evolving with Hatim caring for Abd Rabbuh by promising to be his contact and benefactor in Cairo. In this story, as with the other elderly wealthy characters, Hatim’s happiness is short-lived when Abd Rabbuh leaves him after the guilt he feels for the death of his son

            <p id="text2">
              Though Hatim is of a privileged upper economic class, much of his depiction throughout the film is in dark streets, seedy bars, or the apparent privacy of his Yacoubian Building apartment. For Hatim, as with Zaki Bey and the older generation, the Yacoubian Building “serves as a reminder of the fond memories of the past” (Turan 491). It also provides an apparent safe haven for his secret life, as it does for Haj Azzam’s secret second wife. In contrast to the forced intimacy experienced by the residents of the roof, the wealthy apartment owners experience loneliness in the spacious yet empty apartments.
            </p>

            <p id="text2">
              However, though the spaciousness and single occupancy of the apartments within the building juxtapose the overpopulation of the iron rooms on the roof, there is no more privacy afforded to the residents whose private affairs are still known by the other residents. As with secrets within the building, the secrets are unable to remain hidden in larger society as evidenced by Hatim’s eventual murder by a young cop posing as a date.

              Haj Azzam portrays a “rags to riches” character trope and clearly represents the dual hidden and public lives of Cairene society. Beginning as a migrant to Cairo from the countryside, over a period of thirty years he has gone from a shoe shiner to a self-made millionaire, though his money has actually been made through his side business as a drug dealer. To the public eye Haj Azzam projects the image of an upstanding religious man. He uses a car dealership as a legal front for his dealing business and seeks a socially acceptable and legal outlet to his sexual desires in a second, but secret, marriage to a woman he hides in the Yacoubian Building. Over the course of the film he pursues his dream of running for political office during which the corruption of both his hidden life and Egyptian politics is revealed.

              Haj Azzam’s forward facing life and his secret underground life occupy two very different social stratas of Cairene society. His attempts to compartmentalize and separate these disparate lives is similarly reflected in his movement throughout the city. Unlike some of the other characters, Haj Azzam’s primary means of transportation is driving. Throughout the course of the film, and even of a single day within the film, he travels to various different neighborhoods around Cairo going from the Yacoubian building downtown to a mosque in El-Gamaleya to his car dealership in Maadi. This mobility is afforded to him by his wealthy status, but also a result of his attempts to separate his public and hidden lives. The disconnect between his public and hidden lives is similarly reflected in the disconnectedness of the various locations he visits.

              As the story progresses, Haj Azzam’s dual life becomes increasingly muddled and intertwined as the parts of his life he has tried so hard to keep separate, collapse in on each other. As Haj Azzam navigates the corrupt political landscape, it becomes apparent that his secret narcotics business is not a secret from the government as they try to exploit it for their own profit. Eventually it is revealed that just as it is impossible for the lives of the residents in the Yacoubian Building to remain separate and hidden from one another, it is similarly impossible for Haj Azzam’s secret life to remain hidden from the rest of Cairene society.

              Malak is a shirtmaker and petty schemer that is able to maneuver his way into the Yacoubian Building by way of opening a shop in one of the Iron Houses on the roof. For Malak, the Yacoubian Building provides cheap rent, easy profit and a new set of social connections to aid in his schemes to climb the socio-economic ladder. After securing a shop on the roof, he begins to orchestrate a plan to move down into one of the apartments in the building, enlisting Busayna to trick Zaki Bey into signing over his lease (however she is unable to follow through due to her feelings for Zaki).
            </p>
            <p id="text2">
              The “portrayal of the lives of the rooftop community along with those of the apartment owners creates an upstairs-downstairs dynamic only to have the poor on the upstairs this time, thus subverting the traditional spatial hierarchy that mimics the socio-economic structure of the upper classes occupying the higher level. The overpopulation of the small iron rooms in the rooftop is juxtaposed with the emptiness of the apartments since most of the spacious apartments are inhabited by a single resident, hence highlighting the socio-economic inequality and rupture in the society through spatial order” (Turan 490).
            </p>
            <p id="text2">
              Furthermore, Malak’s attempts to move into the upper class apartments within the building symbolize one of the few paths to gaining socio-economic status within Cairene society, one that relies heavily on deals and back alley transactions which are literally depicted in tight framed shots in the narrow “streets” of the rooftop community. Though his mobility seems to be relatively limited, through Malak we understand that the Yacoubian Building is a microcosm of Egyptian society as a whole and physical integration and vertical mobility within the Building parallels socio-economic mobility within the society.

              Taha is the son of the Yacoubian Building’s doorman and a resident of the building’s roof community who lives in the “Iron Rooms.” These 50 tiny “Iron rooms” were originally dedicated as storage, but after Sadat’s Open Door policy, offices or rentals for Gulf tourists became flats for new poor residents coming from the countryside. These rooms highlight the effects of Nasserist policies and the rural to urban wave that ensued as a result.

              Taha appears to be a brilliant student with hopes to elevate his social status through going through the Police Academy. However, despite his perfect application, the Police Academy rejects Taha based on his father’s low status as a janitor, exemplifying the extent to which society dictates and obstructs socio-economic mobility. Dejected and demoralized, Taha reverts to attending Cairo University where despite the supposed equal opportunities granted by Nasserist policies he is once again marginalised and reduced to the class he represents.

              These subsequent dejections drive him into the arms of the muslim brotherhood’s fundamentalist branches. Initially, Taha is solely a militant attending and organizing rallies against the warming relations between Egypt and Israel. However during one protest turning violent, he is taken in by the police and beaten, tortured, raped and forced to admit Hatim’s homosexuallity. After this traumatic experience, Taha wants revenge against his perpetrator and accepts to become a martyr in the name of his cause. He commits a terrorist attack in the Al Doqi quarters, murders his abusers, but is then killed.

              Taha’s character exposes the rising fundamentalism in Egypt that is a result of years of police state brutality and repression against the lower classes. His story highlights the cycle of violence that has arisen from a militarized government system, but is depicted from an individual’s point of view allowing for a systemic reading of jihadism where the antagonist is Egypt’s declining and corrupt militarized state and the social immobility that ensues  (REFERENCE?).

              For Taha, as for many of the poorer and younger generation residents, the building represents a national past and a society that has alienated and marginalized them based on their inherited economic class. The cramped and impermanent qualities of the rooftop structures parallels the instability and uncertainty the residents feel for their future and their frustration with the poverty and lack of opportunity, which is juxtaposed by the wealthy, older generation’s nostalgic idealized and romanticized image of the Building, society, and nation as a whole. Taha’s desperate attempts to escape his social status manifest physically through his movement around the city. His movement through the city is more widespread and varying than that of any other character, reflecting his constant struggle to find his place that is not barred off to him while also struggling to escape the constraints imposed by society.

              Busayna is the main female character in both the book and movie representing young women in Cairence society. At the outset of the movie Busyana is seen as Taha’s caring and supportive girlfriend, both having grown up in the context of informal Cairo in the Iron rooms on the roof of the Yacoubian Building. In the interaction between Busayna and Taha, her role is decidedly supportive. She represents a gendered society where women are often marginalized and their social and economic mobility is tied to that of the men in their lives, primarily their husbands and fathers. Throughout the film, her character and livelihood always falls in the control of a male character, be it Taha in the beginning or Zaki Bey in the end.

            <p id="text2">
              Early in the film we are introduced to her predestined class and gendered constraints as she searches for a job to help support her family in the wake of her fathers passing. She works at multiple clothing stores where she is sexually harrased by her male employers and fired when she refuses their advances. As the film progresses and Taha radicalises, Busayna holds a more liberal view in contrast and the couple grows apart; she isn't impressed by his blind faith and nationalism when their personal situation is so dire.

              All her interactions with men thus far have been far from desirable. This positions Zaki Bey as the foil and anthesis to all the other men she has encountered thus far. They seem to have a tender relationship despite the age gap. Zaki Bey finds Busayna intelligent and trustworthy while Busayana finds Zaki Bey distinguished, mature and dependable.

              As with Taha, the Yacoubian Building represents a society that has alienated and marginalized them based on their inherited economic class, and in the case of Busayna, gender. Her physical mobility throughout the city expands the most only when her romantic relationship with Zaki Bey is legitimized through marriage, and even then she only moves to new spaces while accompanying Zaki Bey to his old haunts. Her romance with Zaki Bey and the allure she has to him due to his European education and has-been aristocratic lifestyle punctuates the end of the movie alluding to the new generation in Cairo, one that may have been disillusioned by their country, but one who dreams of better prospects either at home or abroad.

        Conclusion
      </p>
      <p id="text1">
        In conclusion, through the depiction of the intertwining lives of the six main protagonists that inhabit the Yacoubian Building, the film posits the Yacoubian Building as a microcosm for Egyption society. The characters’ movement and interactions within the Yacoubian Building reflect the conditions of the larger urban and social fabric that inform Cairene culture and daily life. The ensemble structure of the film allows for a rhizomatic reading of the social and urban conditions that inextricably interweave the lives of the characters and make it impossible to truly isolate and separate the lives of members of different socio-economic classes. The superimposition of the characters’ mapped movements throughout the city explicitly exemplifies the interconnectedness of the multiple heterogeneous social layers that make up Cairene society.
